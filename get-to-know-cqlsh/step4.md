# The `CREATE TABLE` Command

Now that you have a keyspace, you can create a table in your keyspace. To do this in `cqlsh```, use the following command:

`CREATE TABLE user (first_name text, last_name text, title text, PRIMARY KEY (last_name, first_name));`{{execute}}

This creates a new table called &ldquo;user&rdquo; in your current keyspace with three columns to store first and last names and a title, all of type text. The `text` and `varchar` types are synonymous and are used to store strings. You've specified a primary key for this table consisting of the `first_name` and `last_name` and taken the defaults for other table options. For now, let's think of that combination of names as identifying unique rows in your table. The `title` column is the only one in your table that is not part of the primary key.

**Using Keyspace Names in `cqlsh`**

You could have also created this table without switching to your keyspace by using the syntax `CREATE TABLE my_keyspace.user`.

You can use `cqlsh` to get a description of a the table you just created using the `DESCRIBE TABLE` command:

`DESCRIBE TABLE user;`{{execute}}

You'll notice that `cqlsh` prints a nicely formatted version of the `CREATE TABLE` command that you just typed in but also includes default values for all of the available table options that you did not specify.
